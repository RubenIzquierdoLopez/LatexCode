\begin{frame}{Final remarks and future research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We gave an interpretation of dynamics as Lagrangian submanifolds.
    \item We proved a coisotropic reduction theorem in a particular class of multisymplectic manifolds.
    \item For future research we have proposed the following: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Apply the results obtained to Field Theories (regularization, constraint analysis, etc)
        \item Extend these results to multicontact geometry for the study of dissipative fields.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
